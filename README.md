# ome-ngff-implementations

Collect example image data in the [ome-ngff data format](https://github.com/ome/ngff) and ensure that it can be written and read by multiple reference implementations.
Inspired by [zarr-implementations](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations).

This project is in an early state and currently just collects example data / applications for ome.ngff in `playground`.
